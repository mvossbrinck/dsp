[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Question: The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF. What goes wrong? Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

First, we generate the 1000 random numbers:
```{python}
rand = np.random.random(1000)
```

Then, we plot the PMF:
```{python}
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
```

The PMF just looks like a rectangle because each random value is only selected once so there are 1000 unique observations with equal probability. 

We then plot the CDF:
```{python}
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
```

Yes, the distribution is uniform because the CDF is approximately a straight line.
